# Bingo

## About
During COVID19 quarantine in San Francisco, my roommates and I began to miss Monday Night Bingo from our favorite local bar, The Orbit Room. 
After striking out on finding a good Bingo number drawing app, I decided to create the app presented here: https://connor406.github.io/Bingo/

## How to Play
To play this Bingo game, you will need a Bingo card with numbers ranging from B1 - O75. These can be found easily online. Once you 
have your card, press any key or tap the screen to draw a number.

## For Extra Fun
* If you're using a cell phone, turn it sideways to see the entire table on screen
* If you draw 3 of the same letter in a row, you'll see "Three in a Row!" display on screen, feel free to make up a rule when this happens
* If the letters spell out "BIG", the words "Tom Hanks" will display... because that movie is awesome. Feel free to create your own rule 
for this instance as well (ex: sip your favorite drink).
* Continue drawing until a player gets a Bingo!, or until all letters have been drawn and the table is fully illuminated.
